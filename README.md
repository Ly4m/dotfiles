# Ly4m's MacOS Config, Dotfiles and setup

Here are all the configurations and notes on tools that I use when I'm using my MacBook

## OS: 

- Package Manager: [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/)  
  To install pretty much anything on my computer

## Terminal: 

- Emulator: [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)  
  To replace MacOS's default terminal, it has great performances and capabilities.   

- Shell: ZSH with [Oh MY ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/)  
  Default Shell on MacOS highly configurable.  
  Fish is a nice alternative out-of-the-box.    
  My favorite plugins are : z, git and kubectl
